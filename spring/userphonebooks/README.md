HOW TO RUN

1. Create database

            id     | integer               | not null | 

            name   | character varying(25) | not null | 

 
 3. Create table 'records'. Table description:

             id           | integer               | not null |
             phone_owner  | character varying(25) | not null | 
             phone_number | character varying(25) | not null | 
             user_id      | integer               | not null | 

             FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
 
 4. Go to userphonebooks/src/main/resources
 5. Place created database name instead 'dbname' in application.properties and set other data base settings
 6. Go to userphonebooks/
 7. Execute ./gradlew build command 
 8. Execute ./gradlew bootRun command
